# EDA-Academic-Hands-On
Academic Project - Learning and Implementing Exploratory Data Analysis, including PCA, SVD and LDA.

Data: Multiple famous in built dataset like iris, blobs, mnist.

Goal: This was a project designed by the professor to test our understanding and application of Exploratory Data Analysis module learned in the class. This module included topics such as Geometric view, Probabilistic view, Hypercube, Hyperspheres, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decompistion (SVD) and Linear Discriminant Analysis

Approach: Professor provides us with dataset and then asks students to implement certain operations and then asks us explain the results of those operations. A sample practise module is also provided to familiarize with test.

Citation/Acknowledgement: This analysis was done as a part of requirement for CS 6052 - Intelligent Data Analysis course instructed by Dr. Gowtham Atluri at the University of Cincinnati. Most of the sample codes are re used from the practise module.

Score: 10/10
